  - attribution is faster than before
    - actually possible.
    - citizenlab contributor
  - slow to catch govt up to speed on particulars of private network
    - e.g. a network admin showing evidence of attack to govt. Probably takes a while to explain and gain context.

  - data should have *beacons*
    - basically the software analogy of a dye pack that makes it obvious that cash is stolen

#### Panel Discussion
  - Private solutions to attribution are dicey
    a. you continually have to fund the ongoing evolution to security
    b. what do you gain by figuring out who did it?
  - Grizzly Steppe issue
  - Cloudstrike report (crowdstrike?)
    - DNC wouldn't allow FBI to investigate DNC servers, they had to only base their attribution on the Cloudstrike report
  - Microsoft investing into diplomacy
    - "Digital Geneva Convention"
    - if MS sues an entity, that isn't a problem. If the entity comes forward as a foreign govt, that makes it a bigger problem for Microsoft. It's in
      MS best interest for that country to not claim responsibility
  - Countdown to Zero Day book
  - Should companies be able to do 'hot pursuit' and log into the CnC server - get the data back?
